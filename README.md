# Manifest Service

### Overview
This service handles reading from and writing to a user's s3 folder containing their manifests. A manifest is a JSON file that lists records a researcher may be interested in analyzing. This service stores a manifest to a user folder in an s3 bucket and delivers it for later use, such as when the researcher wants to mount the manifest in their workspace. If the "prefix" config variable is set, user folders will be stored in a directory of that name within the s3 bucket.

Manifest files should contain JSON of the form

    [
      {
        "object_id": "757508f5-2697-4700-a69f-89d173a4c514",
        "subject_id": "da6a14a0-6498-4941-a1b2-bbe45a2ccac2"
      },
      {
        "object_id": "835db5c6-5cc8-4d70-a3b2-9a18ad4912cd",
        "subject_id": "da6a14a0-6498-4941-a1b2-bbe45a2ccac2"
      },
      ...
    ]
